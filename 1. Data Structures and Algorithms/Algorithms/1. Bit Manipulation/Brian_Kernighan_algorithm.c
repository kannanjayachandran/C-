/*
    Brian Kernighan's Algorithm : For counting the set bits in a number.

    When we subtract 1 from a number the all the bits following the rightmost 
    set of bits are inverted. Therefore if we do number & (number-1) until the 
    number becomes zero, the number of iteration is the number of set bits.

    Time complexity : Î˜(number of set bits) or O(log(n))

    Space complexity : O(1)
